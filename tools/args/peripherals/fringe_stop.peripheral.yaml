    peripheral_description: |
        "The fringe stopping peripheral is based on piecewise linear coefficients. The coefficients are indicated as offset and step.
        The offset and step are used to calculate an index that is used to select a certain phase from a look-up table. The look-up
        table contains a series of complex values that are based on a sinewave. The length of the look-up table is determined by the
        width of the offset RAM (offset_w). If offset_w = 10 then the length of the look-up table is 2^offset_w=1024. In that case
        the look-up table contains 1024 complex values that make one sine-wave period.
        
        The index is determined as follows:
        
            index(t) = (offset + step*t) MOD 2^offset_w
        
        Where t ranges from 0 to Tmax-1. Tmax is the number of samples that fit in the control interval (the sync interval).
        The fringe stop peripheral is capable to process 1 or more channels in series (nof_channels).
        
        Accumulation Register
        The accumulation register that maintains the accumulated step value is flushed by the sync pulse in the system.
        The accumulation register in the Apertif case is 31 bit wide. For the additon of the offset and the accumulated step the
        10 (offset_w) highest bit of the accumulated value are used --> offset(9:0) + step_accumulated(30:21).
        
        RAMs
        The fringe stop interface is facilitated by two RAMs:
        
            -RAM_FRINGE_STOP_OFFSET
            -RAM_FRINGE_STOP_STEP
        
        Both RAMs are implemented as dual-page RAMs.The page swap is triggered by the sync-pulse. The VHDL is always accessing
        the page that is NOT accessible for the software and vice-versa. This means that the values that are written to the RAMs
        will only be actually used in the following sync-interval:
        
        
        A|         _             T0              _             T1              _            T2 
        A| sync __| |___________________________| |___________________________| |________________________
        A|        |    VHDL uses data T0        |    VHDL uses data T1        |    VHDL uses data T2 
        A|        |    Software writes data T1  |    Software writes data T2  |    Software writes data T3
        A|        |                             |                             | 
        A|    page_swap                     page_swap                     page_swap 
        
        
        The software should be sure to write the next set of data before the sync_interval expires. Keeping track of the
        synchronization with the sync-pulse can be done, using one of the BSN Monitors in the system. In the Apertif system
        the BSN Monitor at the input of the beamformer can be used.
        
        The number_of_fields of both RAMs is determined by the number of unique channels that ought to be processed.
        
        RAM_FRINGE_STOP_OFFSET
        This RAM contains the offset values for all channels, ranging from Channel 0 to Channel Max-1. The width of the RAM is
        defined by the offset_w.
