## Transceiver Reference Clock Placement
## Transceivers should be adjacent to allow timing constraints to be met easily.
## Full details of available transceiver locations can be found in the appropriate
## Transceiver User Guide, or use the Transceiver Wizard.

## These are sample constraints, please use correct constraints for your device
## As per GT recommendation, gt_ref_clk should be connected to the middle quad

## Incase of VCU108-REV-1.0 Evaluation board with xcvu095-ffva2104-2-e-es2 device,
## if user selects CAUI10 GTY default gui configuration with CMAC core as CMAC_SITE_X0Y0
## and GT group X0Y4~X0Y13, the gt_ref_clk pin location is given below
## For other configuration / CMAC and GT locations, update the gt_ref_clk pin location accordingly
## and un-comment the below line 
#set_property PACKAGE_PIN AK38 [get_ports gt_ref_clk_p]

set_property PACKAGE_PIN V38 [get_ports gt_ref_clk_p]

## Change these IO constraints as per your board and device
## For better placement, please LOC the IO's in the same GT SLR region

## For init_clk input pin assignment, if single-ended clock is not available
## on the board, user has to instantiate IBUFDS in Example Design to convert 
## the differential clock to single-ended clock and make the necessary changes
